# Rotating-Sprite
This is an animation program that shows a sprite rotating. It actually doesn't rotate, but instead is animated using different sprites that are drawn with different direction orientations to mimic the look of rotation. This idea was heavily inspired by old games, like Galaga.

Also, the "sprites" are actually 2d arrays of chars. When drawn they can be flipped horizontally and/or vertically, which helped me when making this.
